She
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
Of
climes
and
starry
skies
And
all
thats
best
of
dark
and
bright
Meet
in
her
aspect
and
her
eyes
Thus
to
that
tender
light
Which
heaven
to
gaudy
day
denies
One
shade
the
more
one
ray
the
less
Had
half
the
grace
Which
waves
in
every
raven
tress
Or
softly
oer
her
face
Where
sweet
How
pure
how
dear
their
And
on
that
cheek
and
oer
that
brow
So
soft
so
calm
yet
The
smiles
that
win
the
tints
that
glow
But
tell
of
days
in
spent
A
mind
at
peace
with
all
below
A
heart
whose
love
is
